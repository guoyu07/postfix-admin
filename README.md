Postfix Admin
=============

Sometimes, this will be a simple web frontend to manage an ISP style Postfix/Dovecot installation.
The project is still under heavy development and is far from being production ready.

Basically, the intention of the project is to manage virtual mailboxes and forwardings.

Assumptions
-----------

Postfix, saslauthd, and dovecot are using a mysql backend for the configuration of virtual
mailboxes and forwardings.

the database schema for mailboxes and forwardings is given by
    CREATE TABLE forwardings (source varchar(80) NOT NULL, destination TEXT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (source) );
    CREATE TABLE users (email varchar(80) NOT NULL, password varchar(20) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (email) );
